- If you've reached here you might have already downloaded and unzipped the folder which contains the folders 'myCode'.
- Download the GTSAM MATLAB wrapper and store it at <folder_path>
- Open MATLAB command window and type:
	>> addpath(genpath('<folder_path>'));
- Go to the folder 'myCode'
- Run the scripts hw4_1b, hw4_1c, hw4_2b, hw4_2c
- hw4_1a and hw4_2a are helper functions to read G2O files
- info2cov is a helper function to convert information vector as given in G2o file to corresponding lower cholesky factorization of covariance matrix
